# TAPs Project Charter -- Core Framework

## 1. Purpose & Key Elements

-   **Purpose of TAPs**: Establish a robust, scalable framework to
    develop proactive Technical Assistance Packages (TAPs) for
    Place-Based Planning collaboratives.\
-   **Purpose of this Charter**: Describe objectives, process, tasks,
    roles, expected time commitments, and milestones. These elements may
    be refined during further scoping.\
-   **Definition**: A TAP is a structured, **non-regulatory** report
    that provides baseline technical information and actionable planning
    insights. Enforcement and permitting remain with Watermasters and WR
    staff.\
-   **Main requests from divisions (2025--27 launch)**:
    -   Participation in the **TAPs Working Group** (PCI leads;
        TSD/IT/WR review, feedback, milestone sign-off).\
    -   Assistance with **data snapshot generation** (queries,
        caveat/metadata files; PCI coordinates, TSD/IT lead).\
    -   **Estimated time**: ≤80 hours (TSD) and \~100 hours (IT) for
        launch; \<20 staff-hours/biennium thereafter.

## 2. Scope & Boundaries

**In-Scope**\
- Statewide snapshots from OWRD core systems (WRDB, SWARS/WAB, GWIS)
plus USGS/NWM feeds.\
- Reproducible queries, caveat documentation, and reproducible
Quarto/Python code for TAP generation (including plain-language charts
and narrative).

**Out-of-Scope**\
- New field data collection or new model development/recalibration.\
- Any use of TAPs in enforcement, adjudication, or application review.\
- *(All figures will carry a "Not for enforcement" banner.)*
