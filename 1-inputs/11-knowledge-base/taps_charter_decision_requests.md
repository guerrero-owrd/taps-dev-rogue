# TAPs Project Charter -- Decision Requests (Living Document)

## Purpose

This document tracks TAPs-related **decision requests** requiring
leadership input.\
It is a *living file* that will be updated as project needs evolve.\
Program-level decisions are overseen by **Division Administrators,
Deputy Directors, and the Director**, ensuring TAPs aligns with OWRD's
strategic goals.

    for public releases (e.g., GitHub).

## Update Protocol

    in coordination with the TAPs Working Group.\
