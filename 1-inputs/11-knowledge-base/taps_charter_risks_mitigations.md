  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Risk                    Mitigation

  **TSD capacity          Regularly review workload and adjust resource
  overrun**               allocation based on actual capacity.

  **TAP mis-used in       Permanent "Not for enforcement" banner; staff
  regulation**            briefings; boundary clause in charter.

  **Schema change breaks  Version-controlled code; annual schema check
  pipeline**              two weeks before re-run.

  **Conflicting or        Define clear feedback guidelines. Accept
  unmanageable feedback   narrative/chart suggestions; exclude requests
  from planning groups**  to alter TAP development process.

  **Ambitious timeline**  Track staff time; monitor progress closely;
                          build buffer periods to accommodate delays;
                          adjust milestones as needed.

**Principle:** Risks are tracked at both the technical and program
level. Mitigations prioritize reproducibility, clarity of purpose, and
workload sustainability.
