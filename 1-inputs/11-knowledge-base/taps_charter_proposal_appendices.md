# TAPs Project Proposal & Appendices

## Background

Providing Technical Assistance (TA) is a key role for OWRD in
Place-Based Integrated Water Resources Planning (PBP).\
Evaluations (Independent review, HB 5006 workgroup) highlighted the need
to modernize TA.\
OWRD provides two TA types: **proactive** (anticipatory, standardized)
and **responsive** (by request).

TAPs transform proactive TA into structured, reproducible products
that:\
- Leverage OWRD technical expertise.\
- Support planning requirements.\
- Improve efficiency, consistency, and equity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Vision

Place-Based Planning collaboratives receive high-quality, proactive
technical assistance that provides basin-specific understanding of local
water resources, based on transparent and reproducible OWRD data.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Goal

Establish a rapid, repeatable workflow that produces TAPs offering
standardized, screening-level analysis of OWRD data on Surface Water,
Groundwater, and Water Rights.\
TAPs are **not comprehensive basin assessments** but provide a shared
technical starting point that improves literacy, builds trust, and helps
groups identify where further analysis may be needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is a TAP?

A TAP is a structured report that includes:\
- Three standardized **data snapshots** (Surface Water, Groundwater,
Water Rights).\
- Plain-language interpretations, visualizations, and standardized
metrics aligned with the PBP Handbook.\
- Outputs:\
1. Public summary (1-pager)\
2. Ready-to-paste technical report section\
3. Machine-readable tables/maps

TAPs are **non-regulatory** and best suited for planning areas
\~500--1200 mi² (1300--3,000 km²). Larger basins require modular
application. TAPs are not substitutes for modeling, adjudication, or
enforcement.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## TAP Development Workflow

1.  **Explore** -- Understand data availability and limitations.\
2.  **Summarize** -- Early insights (supply, rights counts) without
    final visuals.\
3.  **Analyze** -- Standardized metrics, spatial overlays, temporal
    summaries.\
4.  **Visualize** -- Technical and community-facing graphics.\
5.  **Interpret** -- Plain-language synthesis, highlight gaps, caveats,
    limitations.

Draft TAPs undergo:\
- **Internal Technical Review** (methods, QA, consistency).\
- **Usability Review** (clarity, relevance, community fit).

Final TAPs published in static, versioned formats (PDF, web-HTML), with
metadata and QA notes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Desired Outcomes (Oct 2026)

-   Standardized, QA-checked **water-data snapshots** (Surface Water,
    Groundwater, Water Rights).\
-   Every planning group receives a TAP with clear charts, maps,
    narratives.\
-   Improved **data literacy & trust** (users locate source data
    independently, guided by a data dictionary).\
-   **Reproducible workflow** -- containerized GitHub repos; TAPs
    rebuildable in \<1 day.\
-   **Integrated coordination** -- TAPs Working Group with clear
    checkpoints.\
-   **Secure handling & public access** -- snapshots in read-only cloud
    bucket, outputs on GitHub Pages.\
-   **Scalable roadmap** -- rollout sequenced with PBP schedule/funding.

# Appendices

## Appendix 1. RACI Roles (Pilot TAP)

-   **Responsible (R)** -- Sr. Technical Analyst runs slicer, executes
    analytics, drafts narrative.\
-   **Accountable (A)** -- Sr. Technical Analyst owns quality and
    delivery; Working Group signs release memo.\
-   **Consulted (C)** -- Snapshot team, WR Data Section, IT, Field
    Services, Engagement staff.\
-   **Informed (I)** -- Staff kept in the loop but not sign-off
    authority.

## Appendix 2. RACI Matrix & Estimated Effort

-   Core staff (Sr. Analyst, Program Coordinator, Data Managers, IT
    staff) each \<80 hours (2025--27).\
-   Field Services & Engagement staff \<20 hours; Comms \<10 hours.\
-   Post-2027: reduced steady-state commitments (≤40 hrs for most
    roles).

## Appendix 3. Wireframe & Core Data Needs

**Surface Water TAP**\
- Snapshot: S-Flow Daily (discharge series, WY 1980--present).\
- Enables: flow trends, baseflow index, event counts.\
- Criterion: *Water Sources & Variability → Surface-Water Trends and
Extreme Events*.

**Groundwater TAP**\
- Snapshot: GW-Well Quarterly (spring-high, non-domestic wells).\
- Enables: groundwater trends, recharge/drawdown, monitoring gaps.\
- Criterion: *Water Sources & Variability → Groundwater Trends*.

**Water Rights TAP**\
- Snapshot: AVPA (annual roll-up of active rights, surface + ground, by
HUC-8).\
- Legal overlays: scenic/withdrawn reaches, GMAs, adjudication status.\
- Enables: consumptive vs instream volumes, seniority profile, rights
hotspots.\
- Criterion: *Water Rights → Rights summary, legal framework,
adjudication status*.
