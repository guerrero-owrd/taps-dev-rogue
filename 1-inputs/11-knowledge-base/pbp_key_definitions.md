# Key Definitions from OAR Chapter 690, Division 602 (Place-Based Planning)

This document compiles **key definitions** from the Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR), Chapter 690, Division 602, which governs Place-Based Integrated Water Resources Planning (PBP). These terms form the foundation for interpreting mandates and technical assistance provisions.

## Definitions

- **Place-Based Integrated Water Resources Plan (PBP Plan)**  
  A locally developed, voluntary plan that addresses water quantity, quality, and ecosystem needs through an integrated approach across sectors, consistent with statewide planning goals.

- **Collaborative**  
  The group of local entities, stakeholders, and community members convened to develop a PBP Plan. Must meet representation, governance, and process standards defined in the rules.

- **Technical Assistance (TA)**  
  Support provided by OWRD and other state agencies to planning collaboratives. The rules distinguish between:
  - **Proactive TA** – standardized, anticipatory resources (e.g., datasets, TAPs, guidance sessions) offered to all groups.
  - **Responsive TA** – assistance provided upon request from planning collaboratives during plan development.

- **PBP Handbook**  
  A document maintained by OWRD that sets out the required structure, evaluation criteria, and procedural guidance for developing PBP Plans. Explicitly mandated in the rules.

- **Evaluation Criteria**  
  Standards and benchmarks used by OWRD to review PBP Plans and determine eligibility for state recognition. Linked directly to the Handbook.

- **Grant Applicant**  
  An eligible entity (e.g., local government, tribe, watershed council) that may apply for funding to support development of a PBP Plan.

- **State Recognition**  
  Formal acknowledgment by OWRD that a PBP Plan meets the required criteria, allowing it to be integrated into statewide water planning and management.

- **Plan Update**  
  A revision or refresh of an already recognized PBP Plan, consistent with timelines and reporting requirements in the rules.

## Observations
- The **Handbook** is central: it operationalizes definitions, criteria, and process expectations.
- **Technical Assistance** is deliberately broad, allowing both standardized (proactive) and on-demand (responsive) support.
- Distinguishing between *Plan Requirements* and *TA* requires careful reading: requirements are fixed; TA exists to help collaboratives meet them.
