# Insights from OAR Chapter 690, Division 602 (Place-Based Planning Rules)

This document summarizes **critical insights** from the Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR), Chapter 690, Division 602, governing **Place-Based Integrated Water Resources Planning (PBP)**. The goal is to clarify what is **explicitly mandated by rule** versus what can be reasonably understood as **technical assistance (TA)**. This helps distinguish required program elements (not TA) from discretionary or supportive actions (TA).

## 1. Explicit Mandates (Not TA)
These are deliverables or structures the rules *require* OWRD (or state agencies collectively) to provide:

- **PBP Handbook**  
  - The rules explicitly reference a *Handbook* that sets expectations for planning content, process, and evaluation.  
  - Since this is a required program element, the *creation, maintenance, and provision* of the Handbook is **not technical assistance**, but rather a mandated agency responsibility.

- **Evaluation Criteria for Plan Recognition**  
  - Rules specify that OWRD must establish criteria for state recognition of PBP plans. These criteria are standardized and not discretionary.  
  - Guidance materials explaining these criteria are part of this mandate, not TA.

- **Formal Application and Grant Processes**  
  - OWRD must administer applications for PBP grants and ensure compliance with timelines, eligibility, and reporting. These are procedural requirements, not TA.

## 2. Technical Assistance (Explicit or Implicit)
The rules do provide for Technical Assistance (TA), both **proactive** and **responsive**:

- **Rule 690-602-0050 (Provision of TA)**  
  - Agencies, in consultation, must develop, maintain, and communicate a *system* for receiving, prioritizing, and responding to TA requests.  
  - This system is TA itself — e.g., staff support, data products, trainings, or interpretive materials.

- **Proactive TA (Implied)**  
  - Examples include TAPs, training sessions, or standard datasets provided early in the planning process to level the playing field across basins.  
  - These are not explicitly mandated deliverables in the rules, so they fall under agency discretion.

- **Responsive TA (Explicitly allowed)**  
  - The rules envision planning groups submitting TA requests during plan development. Agency responses (e.g., answering technical questions, clarifying rules, providing datasets) qualify as TA.

## 3. Ambiguities and Interpretive Notes

- **Guidance Materials Beyond the Handbook**  
  - The rules require a Handbook but also mention that agencies should provide support to planning groups. Guidance documents (e.g., FAQs, checklists, templates) are not mandated by name. These may qualify as TA if produced voluntarily, but could also be read as extensions of the Handbook.

- **Standard Procedures vs. TA**  
  - If something is a required process (e.g., standardized evaluation criteria, compliance steps), it should be considered a **program mandate**.  
  - If something helps groups *apply* or *understand* those processes (e.g., illustrative examples, model templates, technical training), it fits under **technical assistance**.

- **Data Access**  
  - The rules anticipate that OWRD and other agencies will provide access to datasets. But the rules don’t specify the form (raw vs. curated).  
  - Providing raw data access may be a mandate, while producing curated, basin-specific snapshots (like TAPs) would be TA.

## 4. Crosswalk Table: Rule Sections vs. Mandates and TA

| Rule Section | Topic | Mandate | Technical Assistance | Notes |
|--------------|-------|---------|----------------------|-------|
| 690-602-0010 | Purpose | Establishes program scope | — | Framing only |
| 690-602-0020 | Definitions | Required definitions | — | Sets terms for mandates & TA |
| 690-602-0030 | Eligibility for Grants | Admin must manage grant eligibility | — | Procedural, not TA |
| 690-602-0040 | Application Process | Application format & deadlines | — | Administrative, not TA |
| 690-602-0050 | Provision of Technical Assistance | — | Agencies must create and maintain system to provide TA (both proactive & responsive) | Short but key TA section |
| 690-602-0060 | Handbook | Must create and maintain Handbook | — | Explicit mandate; not TA |
| 690-602-0070 | Plan Requirements | Required elements for PBP plans | — | Agencies enforce compliance, not TA |
| 690-602-0080 | Plan Review & State Recognition | Criteria and process for recognition | — | Evaluation criteria mandated |
| 690-602-0090 | Reporting & Updates | Annual/biennial reports required | — | Procedural, not TA |

## 5. Key Takeaways
- The **Handbook** and **Evaluation Criteria** are explicitly mandated; they are program infrastructure, not TA.
- **TA** is discretionary support beyond those mandates, structured into proactive and responsive modes.
- **Guidance documents other than the Handbook** exist in a gray zone — not strictly mandated, but often expected; these may be best characterized as TA unless rules tie them directly to evaluation requirements.
- The **line between mandate and TA** generally follows:  
  - *Mandate = what rules require OWRD to produce or enforce*  
  - *TA = what agencies do to help groups understand, apply, or use those mandates effectively*
