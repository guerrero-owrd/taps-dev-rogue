# TAPs Project Management (IPOM)

Ordered layout: **1-Inputs → 2-Processes → 3-Outputs → 4-Memory**.
The goal is to keep project management agile, reproducible, and readable for both SharePoint and GitHub contexts.  
TAPs are **screening-level, non-regulatory** literacy tools. Enforcement remains with WR staff; every figure carries a "Not for enforcement" banner.

## What this repo is for
- Management tool for the Working group.
- Supports the building of proactive Technical Assistance Packages (TAPs) that provide standardized snapshots and plain-language interpretations.
- Keep governance visible (roles, decisions, risks) and separate **drafts** from **finals**.

## Top-level folders
- **1-inputs**: charter, rules insights, and the simple tables that drive oversight (schedule, RACI, staff-time).
- **2-processes**: working docs, governance, decision log, risk register, roadmap.
- **3-outputs**: final deliverables, engagement copies with comments, and canonical templates.
- **4-memory**: archive of superseded material.

**Quarterly hygiene**: update risks/decisions; archive stale drafts; sync roadmap to actuals.
