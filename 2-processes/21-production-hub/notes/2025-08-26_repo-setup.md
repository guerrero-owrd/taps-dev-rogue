# Meeting Notes — TAPs-PM Repo Setup
**Date:** 2025-08-26  
**Attendees:** FJG (+ AI assistant)

## Agenda
1. Create R Project at repo root (project options hygiene).
2. Build IPOM folder structure via PowerShell.
3. Seed purpose-driven README files.
4. Add 0-how-to with cheatsheets (PowerShell, filesystem).
5. Practice PowerShell commands for future repeatability.

## Decisions (brief — full entries go in 23-decision-log)
- Adopt IPOM structure with numbered subfolders.
- Use `0-how-to/cheatsheets/` but skip `how-to-` prefix in filenames.
- Save R history but **do not** save or restore `.RData` files.
- Use PowerShell for scaffolding; defer renv/Quarto automation for later.
- Meeting/process guidance to live in 0-how-to (cheatsheets and methods).

## Actions
- Seed decision and risk logs with today’s outcomes.
- Add schedule entries for repo setup work.
- Draft cheat-sheets for PowerShell and filesystem navigation.
- Add root README for 0-how-to and cheatsheets README.
- Practice PowerShell folder/file creation regularly.

## Notes
- SharePoint sync can choke on deep/long paths — keep names short and ASCII.
- Governance, risks, roadmap, and decision requests come directly from TAPs Charter docs.
- Outputs must remain non-regulatory and carry “Not for enforcement” banner.
- Finals in 3-outputs; drafts stay in 2-processes; archive superseded docs in 4-memory.## Efficiency baseline (assisted vs manual_est)
- Logged per-task time side-by-side in staff_time.csv.
- Assisted total: 4.0 h. Manual_est total: 8.5 h. Estimated savings ~53%.
- Decision recorded: track manual_est each session (see decisions.csv).
