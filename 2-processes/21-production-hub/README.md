# 21-production-hub

**Purpose:** working docs, meeting notes, draft narratives, in-progress reports.

## Conventions
- One note per meeting. Suggested name: YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md.
- Log **decisions** in 23-decision-log, not only inside notes.
- When a draft is approved, move the final to 31-product-store; keep the draft here.

## Reports you’ll create later
- eports/quarterly.qmd that pulls from decisions.csv, risk_log.csv, and schedule.csv.
