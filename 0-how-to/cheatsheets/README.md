# cheatsheets

This subfolder contains **short, task-focused guides**.  
Each cheat-sheet captures a repeatable action in the TAPs-PM workflow, written in beginner-friendly steps.

## Current contents
- **powershell.md** — How to use PowerShell to build the TAPs-PM file structure.  
- **filesystem.md** — How to navigate the folder system and log activities consistently.

## Future cheat-sheets
- **meetings.md** — Scheduling and conducting project meetings.  
- **coding.md** — Logging progress in code or data repos (e.g., taps-pilot).  
- **quarterly.md** — Updating and rendering quarterly reports.  

## Conventions
- Use clear H1 headings (# Title) describing the action.  
- Keep instructions concise and step-by-step.  
- Scripts should be **copy-paste ready**.  
- When processes evolve, update the cheat-sheet and archive the old version under 4-memory/41-archive.

**Purpose:** provide quick reminders so you don’t waste time re-learning routine tasks.
