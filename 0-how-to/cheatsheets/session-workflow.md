# Session Workflow — Integrated Doing + Logging

This workflow builds muscle memory by fusing **doing the work** with **logging decisions, actions, and notes**.  
Follow this sequence every time you start a TAPs-PM work session.

---

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Note
- Open today’s meeting/work note in `2-processes/21-production-hub/notes/`.
- Add date, attendees (if relevant), and **agenda** = what you plan to do.

### 2. Do
- Work on one agenda item at a time (e.g., “Seed README files”).
- Stay focused on the task itself.

### 3. Crystallize
- As soon as a **decision, action, or learning crystallizes**, jot it *immediately* in the note:
  - **Decision** → under the “Decisions” block.
  - **Action** → under the “Actions” block.
  - **Note/Insight** → under “Notes.”
- Keep entries short; the goal is capture, not polish.

### 4. Log (end of session)
- Scan today’s note and update canonical logs:
  - **Decisions** → `2-processes/23-decision-log/decisions.csv`
  - **Risks** → `2-processes/24-risk-register/risk_log.csv`
  - **Schedule** → `1-inputs/12-analytical-engine/schedule.csv`
  - **Staff time** → `1-inputs/12-analytical-engine/staff_time.csv`
- This step transforms raw notes into structured records.

### 5. Prep (before closing)
- Copy today’s note into a new file dated for the **next session**.
- Pre-fill tomorrow’s agenda with carry-over actions or unfinished items.

## Mantra (repeat at start of each session)
**Note → Do → Crystallize → Log → Prep**

---

## Benefits
- Keeps logging lightweight and in-flow (no giant write-ups at the end).
- Ensures canonical files stay consistent with decisions and actions.
- Creates continuity between sessions: each day starts with a clear agenda.

## Example Daily Rhythm
1. Open note: `2025-08-27_session.md`
2. Work on agenda item: “Finish roadmap README.”
3. Decision crystallizes: jot under “Decisions.”
4. End of session: append decision to `decisions.csv`, update `schedule.csv`.
5. Copy note to `2025-08-28_session.md` with tomorrow’s agenda.
